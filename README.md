   ## ☁️ What is Cloud? (Simple Explanation)

**Cloud computing** means using **computers (servers), storage, databases, and software over the internet instead of your own computer or office servers**.

Instead of buying and maintaining physical machines, you **rent resources online** from cloud providers.

### 🧠 Simple Example:

* Saving files in **Google Drive** instead of your laptop
* Watching movies on **Netflix** instead of downloading them
* Hosting a website on **Amazon Web Services** instead of buying your own server

That’s cloud.
